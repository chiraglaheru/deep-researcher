``retrieve`` and ``analyse`` are the new stages. Retrieval, extraction and
reference discovery all run after the first search round and are reused by every
later round, so the gap-check loop refines the same evidence base instead of
re-downloading the corpus.

Only search, gap_check, contradiction_check and report use the LLM. Everything
between them -- downloading, parsing, chunking, relevance scoring, reference
numbering, the reference table -- is deterministic.
