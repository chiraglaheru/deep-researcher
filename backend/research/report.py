"""Deep report generation.

The old generator handed one model call a wall of snippets and asked for a
report. That compressed everything, dropped most citations, and made it
impossible to tell which finding came from where.

The generator here is section-wise. Each section is written by its own call,
given only the evidence relevant to it, and citing from a fixed reference
numbering that is assigned deterministically before any model runs. That last
part is what makes traceability structural rather than aspirational: a citation
in the prose can always be resolved to a real document URL, because the
reference list was built from the evidence records themselves and the model
cannot invent a number that does not exist there.

Sections are chosen deterministically from the dimensions the user asked about,
not by a model, so the report shape is predictable and the call budget holds.

DISCIPLINE = """CITATION RULES (these are not optional):
- Cite with the bracketed reference numbers given to you, e.g. [3] or [3][7].
- Place the citation immediately after the specific claim it supports, not at
  the end of a paragraph containing several unrelated claims.
- Cite every number, date, price, measurement and comparative claim.
- Use ONLY reference numbers that appear in your evidence list. Never invent one.
- If the evidence does not support a claim, do not make the claim. Write
  "the evidence gathered does not establish this" instead.
- Never fabricate a statistic, benchmark result, paper finding, author or URL.

EVIDENCE HONESTY RULES:
- Distinguish what a source measured from what someone concluded about it.
- State the conditions behind a number: device, build type, workload, date,
  sample size, methodology. If the evidence does not say, say it does not say.
- A vendor's claim about its own product is an interested party, not an
  independent measurement. Label it as such.
- One benchmark is not a general ranking. Say what the benchmark covered.
- When sources disagree, present both positions and say whether the evidence
  resolves the disagreement. If it does not, say so plainly.
- Never turn limited evidence into a universal conclusion.
- Say "the evidence is insufficient on this point" when it is. That is a
  legitimate and valuable finding, not a failure.

STYLE RULES:
- Write in continuous prose under the given heading. Do not use bullet lists
  for analysis; use them only for compact enumerations of scenarios.
- Every paragraph must add evidence, comparison or reasoning. Never restate a
  conclusion, pad, or paraphrase the previous paragraph.
- Be specific and technical. Name the frameworks, mechanisms, versions and
  measurements involved.
- Do not open with filler such as "In today's fast-moving world".
- Aim for the requested depth. Length must come from evidence, not repetition."""

EXEC_SYSTEM = f"""You write the executive summary of a research report.

Summarise the findings that the detailed sections below establish. Lead with
the substantive answer, then the principal trade-offs, then what remains
uncertain. Do not introduce any fact, number or claim that does not appear in
the evidence given to you.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

METHOD_SYSTEM = f"""You write the Scope and Methodology section of a research report.

State plainly and concretely: what was investigated, which options were
compared and how they were defined, the date range and recency of the evidence,
how sources were selected, how conflicting evidence was handled, and what the
method cannot establish. Be specific about the actual limitations of this
research run -- which sources were only partially retrievable, which questions
got thin coverage, and what a reader should therefore be cautious about.

Do not claim a comprehensiveness the run did not have.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

DIMENSION_SYSTEM = f"""You write one analytical section of a research report, covering a
single dimension of a comparison.

Structure the section as analysis, not as a list:
- Open by stating what this dimension actually means and why it is contested or
  trade-off shaped, where that applies.
- Analyse each option being compared separately and concretely.
- Compare them directly against each other.
- Present concrete evidence with its conditions attached.
- Explain the caveats, the methodology behind each measurement, and the
  situations in which the ranking would change.
- Close with what the evidence does and does not settle about this dimension.

Where the dimension involves measurement, treat it as multidimensional rather
than as one headline number. Decide for yourself which sub-metrics matter in
this domain -- work out what the dimension is actually made of, then say which
components you can evidence and which you cannot. Wherever a figure appears,
state what was measured, on what, under what conditions, with what method, and
whether it generalises beyond the case that was measured.

Where the dimension involves cost, separate the one-off cost from the recurring
cost, and separate the components of each rather than quoting a single total.

If evidence for part of the dimension is thin or missing, analyse what you have
and state plainly what is missing.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

CONFLICT_SYSTEM = f"""You write the section reconciling conflicting evidence.

For each disagreement present both positions, name the sources, then compare
them on everything that could explain the gap: methodology, date, population or
sample, scale, configuration, definitions, and the incentives of whoever
produced each result. Offer the most likely reasons for the disagreement. Say
which result is more generalisable and why, or state that the evidence does not
resolve it.

Do not silently prefer the position that fits a tidy conclusion.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

SCENARIO_SYSTEM = f"""You write the scenario analysis section of a research report.

Derive the scenarios from THIS question rather than from any fixed template.
Identify the options being compared and the constraints that actually vary
between real cases in this domain, then write scenarios that differ along those
axes -- for example scale and resources, degree of specialisation, sensitivity
to a particular risk, the audience or population affected, or the time horizon
over which the decision plays out. Ignore any example that does not fit.

For each scenario, state what the constraints imply for the trade-offs that
decide the outcome, give a reasoned recommendation grounded in cited evidence,
and name the condition that would flip it. Do not produce a universal ranking.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

DECISION_SYSTEM = f"""You write the decision framework section of a research report.

Do not tell the reader which option to choose. Instead give them the reasoning
they need to choose: what to prioritise under each constraint, which trade-offs
become decisive under which condition, how existing team expertise changes the
economics, and what the reversal conditions are.

Organise this as conditional guidance -- "if X matters most, then Y" -- tied to
the evidence. Make clear what is a judgement rather than a finding.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

QUALITY_SYSTEM = f"""You write the evidence quality and limitations section.

State what the evidence base actually consisted of: how many sources, of what
types, how recent, how much was fully retrievable versus snippet-only, and how
that shapes confidence. Explain the quality tiers in use and why findings were
placed in them. Name the specific weaknesses of this research run and what a
reader should not conclude from it.

Be candid. This section exists to stop over-reading the rest of the report.

{DISCIPLINE}"""

CONCLUSION_SYSTEM = f"""You write the conclusion of a research report.

Synthesise the strongest evidence into a balanced position. Separate what the
evidence establishes from what is interpretation. Name the genuinely uncertain
areas and the trade-offs that do not resolve. Give no universal verdict the
evidence does not support. Close with what would change the answer.
