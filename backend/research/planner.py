"""Question → sub-questions, deduplicated.

A planner asked to split one question into sub-questions frequently returns the
same sub-question twice, or two phrasings of it. Those duplicates waste a
parallel search slot and skew the evidence base, because the same material is
retrieved and cited twice while another dimension goes unresearched.

Duplicates are detected deterministically, then replaced by asking the planner
again for fresh ones. If it cannot supply replacements, the run proceeds with
what survived -- a smaller plan is better than no plan.
