"""Batched LLM evidence extraction and per-source synthesis.

The design constraint is that evidence throughput per model call has to be high:
extracting one finding at a time would mean hundreds of calls for a single
report. So passages are packed to a character budget and many chunks go into
each request, and one request yields every finding those chunks support.

Two deterministic guards run afterwards, because a model will happily produce a
plausible citation for a passage that does not contain it:

  * a record naming a chunk that was not in the batch is discarded
  * a quote that cannot be found in its passage is downgraded, then discarded

That means a surviving record's provenance is real rather than asserted.

You extract research evidence from source passages.

You are given numbered passages, each with an id like S3#2 (source 3, chunk 2).
For each passage, extract only the findings that actually bear on the research
question and its dimensions.

Rules you must follow:

1. GROUND EVERY RECORD IN ITS PASSAGE. Copy the supporting sentence verbatim into
   "quote". If you cannot quote it, do not report it. Never invent a number,
   a benchmark result, a paper finding, or a URL.
2. STATE FINDINGS AS CHECKABLE CLAIMS, not as impressions. Give the specific
   measured value or documented fact and the conditions it holds under -- not a
   vague statement that something is "better", "faster" or "more mature".
3. KEEP THE CONDITIONS WITH THE NUMBER. If a figure only holds for a debug build,
   one device, one workload or one date, say so in "detail".
4. RECORD DISAGREEMENT. If a passage contradicts another passage or a known
   vendor claim, note it in "limitations".
5. CLASSIFY HONESTLY:
   strong     = primary data, transparent measurement, official documentation
   moderate   = credible secondary analysis, well-sourced industry reporting
   weak       = single anecdote, undated blog, opinion, unverified claim
   anecdotal  = a person's experience report
   speculative= prediction, forecast, vendor marketing with no measurement
   Marketing claims from a vendor about its own product are never "strong".
6. SKIP PASSAGES WITH NOTHING USEFUL. Return no record for them. An empty
   result for a passage is correct and cheap.

Return JSON only:
{"evidence":[{"chunk":"S3#2","claim":"...","detail":"...","quote":"verbatim sentence",
"dimension":"one of the dimensions, or an empty string","targets":["..."],
"quality":"strong|moderate|weak|anecdotal|speculative","limitations":"...","confidence":0.0}]}"""
