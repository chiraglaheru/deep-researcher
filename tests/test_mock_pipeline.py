"""End-to-end tests of the real graph running entirely on mock mode.

No real model or SerpApi call happens in this file.

Note on layers: deep_research() yields only graph events. The terminal "done"
marker and the conversion of a failure into an "error" event both live in
backend/main.py, so any assertion about "done" or "error" goes through the
HTTP endpoint rather than through deep_research() directly.
